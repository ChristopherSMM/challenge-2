# challenge-2
in this project we were given the task to create a portfollio that we would edit over time and continue to add to durring the bootcamp.
This project consists of both HTML and CSS Elements that attempt to create a small website that introduces me, shows my previous work(s) and how to contact me through email or phone number
i was motivated to do this project because i will have trouble with css and wanted to improve on how to properly move text and how to customize my website
